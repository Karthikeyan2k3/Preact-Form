# Preact-Form

This is a basic form built with Preact using only signals, no hooks were used.

The official [Preact documentation](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/forms) was written with the focus set on React developers jumping ship in search of a minimal quasi drop-in replacement which complements the heavy usage of the concept of ReactJS hooks, useState, useEffect, the whole nine yards. This as seen is extended even to the forms section under Preact's documentation, hooks everywhere! I, on the other hand felt strongly that PreactJS signals should be pushed more as an individial trait which holds better when building UI's instead of hooks.
